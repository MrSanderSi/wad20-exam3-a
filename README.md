2. Have a **computed property** called `sortedFlights` 
that sorts received list by departure (earliest to latest by default) _**[6 points]**_

total price of all flights and display it in the `span`
 element that has the **id** `total` _**[6 points]**_

toggle order of the list by departure time, from latest to earliest and vice versa _**[5 points]**_
5. have a filter `timeFormat` that formats departure and arrival times into this format `Jan 30, 2021 3:15 PM`,
 Note: to make it easy, use `moment.js` library which is already installed.  _**[3 points]**_
